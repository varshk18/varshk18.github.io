							<b>Data Science Intern at eShipz.com - Smart automated enterprise shipping(Jan 2021 - April 2021)</b></br>
							<a href = "https://github.com/varshapandian/courier-recommendation-engine "><b>PROJECT : COURIER RECOMMENDATION ENGINE FOR E-COMMERCE SHIPPING</b></a>
							<p>Current rule-based systems for courier recommendations are hard to maintain and not easy to
								accommodate the changes in trends in courier performance. ML system can automatically be re-trained to utilize recent history and account for seasonal and annual change in behaviour. 
							   Hence, a machine learning model which predicts the most efficient courier partner based on the 
			                   delivery performance of the courier is developed. </p>
							   <h2>KEY PROJECTS</h2>
							   <a href = "https://github.com/varshapandian/covid-19-classifier "><b>GPU ENABLED CNN BASED COVID-19 HRCT IMAGES CLASSIFIER</b></a>
							<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a bottleneck in the healthcare system around the world. Deep learning
								offers a convenient tool for diagnosing and predicting the severity of lung infection in CT images for 
								COVID-19 patients.
								A 3D U-Net architecture for segmenting the 
								lung from the CT scans and 3D CNN architecture for classification and scoring of the severity of the CT scans is used.
                             </p>
							 <a href = "https://github.com/varshapandian/finance-tracker"><b> PERSONAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION</b></a>
							<p>This is a personal finance management application with features that are beneficial for managing the finance of users.
								The personal finance management app developed includes updating income, tracking expenses and sending alerts at the right time, etc.
								Each of these activities involves accessing information from different locations, collecting and consolidating monetary information. 
								This app helps users to set their goals, keep track of their income and expenses by monthly basis.
                            </p>
							<a href = "https://github.com/varshapandian/data-extraction-twitter"><b> TWITTER DATA EXTRACTION</b></a>
							<p>Extraction of data from Twitter in Java using Twitter4j. It's functionalities include 
								getting Twitter timeline of the user/ trends on Twitter/ friends and followers of any public user, searching tweets using keywords, 
								
							posting and delete status, and sending personal message to followers.
